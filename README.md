# Dimensionality-Reduction-in-Breast-Cancer-Analysis-Using-PCA
In this project, the built-in breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn is used to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is applied to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while retaining key variance, making it easier to visualize and analyze the underlying patterns in the breast cancer data.
